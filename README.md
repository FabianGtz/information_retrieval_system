# Information Retrieval System 
   
The goal of this project is to implement a basic information retrieval system using Python, NLTK and GenSIM. 

To build this system, it is provided a plain text MED.ALL that contains many documents related to life sciences. Each document is composed by 2 fields (.I and .W). The field .I contains a numeric ID that identifies the document, while the field .W contains the text of the document.

For this system is created at least 3 different versions using different weights for building the vectors representing documents and queries.
